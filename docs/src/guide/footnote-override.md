# Footnote Text Override

As of version 2.5.1 of the theme, the option to replace the text that appears in the footnote has been added. This means that it is now possible to replace the default text (_Publlished with Ghost_) with the text of your choice.

This new option can be found in the theme design settings as shown below:

If for some reason you wish to restore the default text, just clear the text you have entered in the corresponding field.

::: warning
This option is only available if you're using Ghost 4.20.0 or later and Weiss Pro 2.5.1 or later.
