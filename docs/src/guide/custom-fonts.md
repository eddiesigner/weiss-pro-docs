# Custom Fonts

As of version 3.5.0 of the theme, support for [custom fonts](https://ghost.org/tutorials/email/ad58caee-4c78-4241-9a24-5dd2bd90753c/) has been added, this means that it is now possible to replace the default fonts of the theme with the fonts that Ghost offers natively. This allows publishers to have more control over their branding and have a wider range of options to customize their publication.

This new option can be found in the design **brand settings** as shown below:

If you want to return to the default fonts, simply select the **Theme default** option in the corresponding field.

::: warning
This option is only available if you're using Ghost 5.101.0 or later and Weiss Pro 3.5.0 or later.
