You do not need to add content to this page as it is automatically generated.

If you decide to use another title for this page it is important that you manually change the **Page URL** in the page settings so that the value is `authors`, otherwise it will not work.

If you want to use a different URL, `team` for example, you have to unzip the theme folder, rename the file `page-authors.hbs` to `page-team.hbs`, zip the theme folder and upload it again.
